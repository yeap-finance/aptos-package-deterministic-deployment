/// This module allows users to deploy, upgrade and freeze modules deployed to objects on-chain.
/// This enables users to deploy modules to objects with deterministic addresses based on a custom seed.
/// This modules provides an alternative method to publish code on-chain, where code is deployed to objects rather than accounts.
/// This is encouraged as it abstracts the necessary resources needed for deploying modules,
/// along with the required authorization to upgrade and freeze modules.
///
/// The functionalities of this module are as follows.
///
/// Publishing modules flow:
/// 1. Create a new object with the address derived from the publisher address and a custom deterministic seed.
/// 2. Publish the module passed in the function via `metadata_serialized` and `code` to the newly created object.
/// 3. Emits 'Publish' event with the address of the newly created object.
/// 4. Create a `ManagingRefs` which stores the extend ref of the newly created object.
/// Note: This is needed to upgrade the code as the signer must be generated to upgrade the existing code in an object.
///
/// Upgrading modules flow:
/// 1. Assert the `code_object` passed in the function is owned by the `publisher`.
/// 2. Assert the `code_object` passed in the function exists in global storage.
/// 2. Retrieve the `ExtendRef` from the `code_object` and generate the signer from this.
/// 3. Upgrade the module with the `metadata_serialized` and `code` passed in the function.
/// 4. Emits 'Upgrade' event with the address of the object with the upgraded code.
/// Note: If the modules were deployed as immutable when calling `publish`, the upgrade will fail.
///
/// Freezing modules flow:
/// 1. Assert the `code_object` passed in the function exists in global storage.
/// 2. Assert the `code_object` passed in the function is owned by the `publisher`.
/// 3. Mark all the modules in the `code_object` as immutable.
/// 4. Emits 'Freeze' event with the address of the object with the frozen code.
/// Note: There is no unfreeze function as this gives no benefit if the user can freeze/unfreeze modules at will.
///       Once modules are marked as immutable, they cannot be made mutable again.
