# Yeaptor configuration example (TOML)
#
# Summary
# - format_version: Schema version (use 1)
# - yeaptor_address: On-chain address used by Yeaptor tooling (e.g., common framework/module addr)
# - publishers: Map of alias -> on-chain address (hex string)
# - named-addresses: Optional map of Move named addresses reused across packages
# - deployments: Ordered list of deployments. Each defines a single resource account derived from
#   (publisher + seed), and an ordered list of packages to publish under it. Each package is
#   an object with { address_name, path }.
#
# Ordering
# - Deployments are processed in the order they appear.
# - Packages within a deployment are processed in the order they appear.
# - No explicit dependency declarations; order the arrays as desired.

format_version = 1
yeaptor_address = "0x1"

[publishers]
# Alias -> on-chain address
yeap-multisig = "0x10"
# another-publisher = "0xabc123..."

# Optional: shared Move named addresses (if your packages reference them)
# Keys are Move named address identifiers; values are on-chain addresses
[named-addresses]
# std = "0x1"
# my_framework = "0xfeed"

# Deployments: each item describes one resource account and the packages to publish into it
# Use a publisher alias from [publishers] or a literal on-chain address
# `seed` must be UTF-8 text (not hex)

# Deployment 1: core stack
[[deployments]]
publisher = "yeap-multisig"   # alias from [publishers]
seed = "core-v1"              # UTF-8 seed
packages = [
  { address_name = "ra_code_deployment", path = "packages/resource-account-code-deployment" },
  { address_name = "proxy_account",      path = "packages/proxy-account" },
]

# Deployment 2: payments stack
[[deployments]]
publisher = "yeap-multisig"
seed = "payments-v1"          # UTF-8 seed
packages = [
  # { address_name = "payments_pkg", path = "packages/payments" },
]

# Tips
# - Keep format_version = 1.
# - Define publisher aliases once under [publishers], then reference them in deployments.
# - Use a consistent seed to target the same resource account across runs.
# - seed must be UTF-8 text (not hex).
# - `path` must point to a Move package root directory containing Move.toml.
# - Add deployments and packages in the exact order you want them processed.
